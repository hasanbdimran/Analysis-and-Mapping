# Analysis-and-Mapping
Data loading from 99 excel sheet and conducting analysis and mapping
## Data
The UNICEF MAR project was formulated to implement better optimization and sustainable managed aquifer recharge. For this purpose data have been collected from 99 MAR sites. All these sites are situated in Bangladesh and distributed over three districts; Shatkhira, Khulna and Bagerhat. The time series data have been collected from each site. The mentionable data types are Water volume meter reading (infiltration and abstraction), salinity (EC values), Arsecnic concentration and turbidity.
## Analysis
Fresh water recovery efficiency has been calculated on this code. Recovery efficiency has been calculated on each site. After that the recovery efficiency of each site is showed on a map through color graduation of recovery efficiency value.
